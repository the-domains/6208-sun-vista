# The Barnyard

Raising chickens in backyards is becoming more and more popular and is legal in Austin. (However, you are not allowed to have a rooster.) With the bird flu epidemic, backyard chicken raising is an even better idea than before. It is easier to keep your little flock healthy than it is for the big producers and your chickens will produce the most lovely eggs at time when eggs are in short supply. 

The Funky Austin Chicken Tour happens every year on the Saturday before Easter and is a great way to see how Austinites are enjoying their mini-flocks of poultry. 

The Sun Vista barnyard currently houses 5 chickens and 6 rabbits. The chicken coop conveys -- the chickens do NOT! It is sitting on a concrete slab and is very secure from predators. In fact, no predators have gotten any of our chickens. 

The bunnies are just so darn cute and if you have the stomach for it, they are a great meat supply. The bunnies don't convey either and neither does their hutch, which is portable. However, if you would like to buy it, that could possibly be arranged.
