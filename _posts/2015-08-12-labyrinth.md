# **Labyrinth**

The
labyrinth is an ancient prayer and meditation tool. There are many websites
that talk about the history of the labyrinth and how to use one. This labyrinth
can be left as is or the owners can remove the bricks and refill the trenches
with good garden soil prior to closing. The grass will quickly fill in.
